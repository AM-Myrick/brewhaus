# brewhaus
Brewhaus is a simple beer listing app made with Vue 3, Bootstrap, and the Composition API. It features pagination, a details page with more information on the selected beer, a simple search by name, and an advanced search for queries that follow this pattern: `(param): value` ex. `abv_gt: 7` will return all beers with an alcohol by volume greater than 7.

To run the app locally, clone this repo, cd into the client folder, then run `npm i` and `npm run dev`.
